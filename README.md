# KESACCO: Keen Event Simulation and Analysis for CTA Cluster Observations

This repository contains a software dedicated to the simulation of CTA event files 
corresponding to the observation of galaxy clusters. The event files can then be analyzed 
to produce CTA analysis results.
                                                            
- clustpipe.py : 
	Main code that defines the class ClusterPipe.
    
- clustpipe_common.py : 
  Subclass that defines common tools.
   
- clustpipe_sim.py : 
  Subclass that deal with event simulation.
        
- clustpipe_ana.py : 
  Subclass that deal with observation analysis.
    
- clustpipe_{ana,sim}_plot.py : 
  Sub-modules dedicated to run automatic plots related to analysis
  and simulations.

- clustpipe_title.py : 
	Title for the software.

- Tools :
  Repository that gather several useful libraries and run ctools scripts.
  It also contain the compact source, background, and observation setup 
  classes.

- notebook :
	Repository where to find Jupyter notebook used for development/example. 

## Environment
To be compliant with other softwares developed in parallel, the code was made for python 2. Please make sure that you are in the correct environment when you run the code.
In addition, the ClusterPipe directory should be in your python path so it can be found.

## Installation
To install these tools, just fork the repository to your favorite location in your machine.
The software depends on standard python package (non-exhaustive list yet):
- astropy
- matplotlib
- random
- numpy
- os
- copy
- pickle

But also:
- gammalib (http://cta.irap.omp.eu/gammalib/)
- ctools (http://cta.irap.omp.eu/ctools/)
- minot (see https://github.com/remi-adam/minot)
